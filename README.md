# Titanic : Machine Learninig for disaster (Data science Soution of the Titanic kaggle competition)

This file contains all the details about the competition and the steps followed to get the solution

# Steps followed : 

  1.Define the question or the problem. <br /> 
  2.Aquire the training and testing data set. <br /> 
  3.Wrangle,clean the data(Nan values...).<br /> 
  4.Anlyze the data, identify patterns and maybe create new features.<br /> 
  5.set the model and finally predict(In this case if the passengers on the training data set survived or not) 
  
  
# Algorithms studied :
    1.Logistic Regression.  <br />
    2.KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors. <br />
    3.Support Vector Machines.  <br />
    4.Naive Bayes classifier.  <br />
    5.Decision Tree.  <br />
    6.Random Forrest.
